# Google Student Community's DITU Hacktoberfest Repository

**Welcome to Open-Source!**

As being a community, we value open-source contribution as being the best way to spread knowledge and awareness about the perks and merits of open-source software used in the industry, and how to contribute in building an open future.

## What is HacktoberFest? 
[ Hacktoberfest ‚Äî brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with DEV ](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) ‚Äî is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors toward issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered. No contribution is too small ‚Äî bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.

Can't make it to this event? Hacktoberfest is virtual and open to participants from around the globe. Sign up to participate today at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com.
